## A/B test bakery description

I prepared data for A/B testing. Then I made analyst of data, then I made a decision about statistical significance.

## Kaggle Digit Recognizer
I used data on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer).
I created model of neural networks for recognizing digits.

## Parsing data

I received data about current weather on [the site](https://openweathermap.org/).
Then I wrote forecast of weather in London and Moscow.

## Search best tree/Titanic ML/Tree cats predict

The projects on work with [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). I tuned parameters of RandomForest/xgboost.
Also I compared traits of GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
